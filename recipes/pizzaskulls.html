      <li>
        3/4 cup pizza sauce, plus more for serving

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400℉. Working on a clean surface, roll out dough to a 15- x 10-inch rectangle. Cut dough into 6 (5- x 5-inch) squares.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with one piece of dough at a time, lay one square of dough in one cavity of a nonstick 6-cavity skull-shaped cakelet pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill the dough by layering 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon pizza sauce, 1 tablespoon pepperoni, 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon pizza sauce, 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon parmesan, and 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning in the center of the dough square.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold sides of dough together and pinch tightly to seal, trimming and discarding any excess dough if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat filling and sealing process with remaining dough squares and remaining cheese, pizza sauce, pepperoni, and Italian seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until baked through and lightly golden, 16 to 18 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove baked skulls from pan and transfer to a serving plate. Let cool 5 minutes before serving with additional pizza sauce for dipping, if desired.
